            The Crow and the Pitcher
        </h3>
        <p>
            In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tried, the Crow could not reach the water.
        </p>
        <p>
            The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then an idea came to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
            With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink.

            The cow jumped over the moon.

        <p>
            The little dog laughed
        </p>
        <p>
            To see such sport
        </p>
        <p>
            And the dish ran away with the spoon.

            Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

        <p>
            Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

            Went up the hill  
        </p>
        <p>
            To fetch a pail of water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jack fell down
        </p>
        <p>
            And broke his crown
        </p>
        <p>
            And Jill came tumbling after.

            Mary Had a Little Lamb

        <p>
            Its fleece was white as snow

        <p>
            And everywhere that Mary went
        </p>
        <p>
            The lamb was sure to go.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It followed her to school one day
        </p>
        <p>
            That was against the rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            It made the children laugh and play
        </p>
        <p>
            To see a lamb at school.
